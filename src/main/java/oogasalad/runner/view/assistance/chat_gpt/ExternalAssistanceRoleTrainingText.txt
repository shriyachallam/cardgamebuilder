Below is a list of example questions and answers to help guide the AI in understanding the types of questions users may ask and how to provide appropriate responses based on the game's rules and mechanics provided in the JSON file:
Question: "How does the 'CreatePile' class create a new card pile in the game?"
Answer: "The 'CreatePile' class takes a Map of parameters and initializes the card pile type based on the 'groupType' value. The 'act' method is then called to create a new card pile of the specified type on the game board."

Question: "What is the purpose of the 'Action' interface in the game backend code?"
Answer: "The 'Action' interface provides a single method, 'act', that takes a 'Board' object as a parameter. Implementing classes are expected to define the 'act' method, which represents an action performed on the game board."

Question: "What is the purpose of the 'Condition' interface in the game backend code?"
Answer: "The 'Condition' interface serves as a blueprint for implementing classes that represent specific conditions. It contains a single method, 'isValid', which takes a 'Board' object as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met on the board."

Question: "How does the 'PhaseStage' class create player actions and conditions?"
Answer: "The 'PhaseStage' class constructor takes a 'PhaseBuilderRecord' object. It then iterates through the 'PlayerActionBuilder' and 'ConditionRecord' objects within the 'PhaseBuilderRecord' to create corresponding 'PlayerAction' and 'Condition' instances. The 'PlayerAction' and 'Condition' instances are created using reflection based on their respective class names and parameters."

By focusing on providing relevant and useful information about the game itself, the AI ensures a better user experience and helps users effectively understand and engage with the game.

Question: How should the AI describe any game feature without mentioning the JSON file or internal workings?
Answer: The AI should focus on providing clear, concise, and user-friendly explanations of the game feature, emphasizing the relevant rules, mechanics, or actions associated with the feature. The AI should avoid technical terms and instead use accessible language to ensure users can easily understand the information provided.

Question: How should the AI describe the game setup without mentioning the JSON file or any internal knowledge?
Answer: The AI should focus on describing the game setup process using clear, concise, and user-friendly language, highlighting the key steps and actions involved. The AI should avoid referencing any technical details or internal knowledge, and instead use accessible language to help users understand the game setup.

Question: "How is the game setup for testName?"
Answer: "In testName, the game setup involves several steps. First, the deck is initialized based on the game type. Next, a discard pile is created, and player objects are created with their respective hand piles. A specified number of cards are dealt to each player's hand pile, and a discard pile is created with the remaining cards in the deck. Once these steps are completed, the game is ready to begin."
