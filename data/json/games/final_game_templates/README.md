automatically visible to the Game Runner. Any file that is placed here will appear in the startup screen 
as a button that a player can click to launch a new version of the game.

## Formatting Game Names

To allow your game to display properlly format the name of your final JSON file as follows
``GameName.json`` where **each capital letter will create a space in the name that appears on the run button.**
