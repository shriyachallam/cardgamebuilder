# Games Folder

Each subdirectory contains files relating to a specific game. 
When creating a new game, please create a new subdirectory and place all files relating to that game in that subdirectory.
*Put template file(s) in the subdirectory and create a folder within the subdirectory called "saved_games" to store saved examples
of your game. Also include a README file in the subdirectory that describes the game.*

## Template Files

Template files are used to create new games. They are used by the game creator to create a new game and by the game player to play the game.

## Saved Games

Saved games are examples of games that have been created using the template files. They are used by the game player to play the game.
They include players, game state, and a copy of the template files used to create the game. ***Please save multiple examples of your game in various states.***
