# Gin Rummy

The objective of Gin Rummy is to get rid of all of your cards. Each player is dealt 7 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table. The top card is turned face up and placed next to the deck. This card is the discard pile. The game begins with the player to the left of the dealer.

## Game Play

A player can start their turn by either picking up the top card from the discard pile or the top card from the deck, then clicking "end phase."'

In the second phase the player can get rid of cards by playing runs or melds on the board.

* A run is 3 or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order. 
* A meld is 3 or more cards of the same rank. Aces are high.

A player can also add cards to existing runs or melds on the board.

For the final phase, the player can discard a card from their hand and end the phase to complete their turn.

## Winning

A player wins when they have no cards left in their hand. The game ends and the player with no cards in their hand wins.
