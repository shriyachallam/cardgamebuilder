# Four Card Gin -- Ken Kalin

The goal of Gin is to get rid of all of your cards. Each player is dealt 4 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table. The top card is turned face up and placed next to the deck. This card is the discard pile. The game begins with the player to the left of the dealer. 

## Game Play

A player can start their turn by either picking up the top card from the discard pile or the top card from the deck, then clicking "end phase."

At this point, the player can "knock" if they can win the game. If they cannot knock, the player can then discard a card from their hand and end the phase to complete their turn.

## Knocking

A player can "knock" if they have either a Run or Meld in their hand and one extra card.

* A Run is 3 or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order. 
* A Meld is 3 or more cards of the same rank. Aces are high.

To win the game by knocking, the player must create a set on the board and then play the run or meld.
Then they can end the phase leaving one card in their hand (which the computer checks they can discard).
***The player must not play/discard all cards in their hand during knocking. There must be one card left in their hand.***
